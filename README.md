# Urban Budget Analysis and Development Standards Model :octocat:

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a sophisticated model designed to analyze urban budget expenses and development standards. The model aims to provide insights into how urban areas allocate their financial resources and adhere to development guidelines. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, the model can help city planners, policymakers, and researchers make informed decisions to improve urban development and financial management.

## Features

- **Budget Analysis**: The model can break down urban budgets into various categories, such as infrastructure, education, healthcare, and public services. It provides detailed reports on spending patterns and identifies areas of over or under-spending.
- **Development Standards Assessment**: The model evaluates urban development projects against established standards and guidelines. It ensures that projects meet regulatory requirements and align with long-term urban planning goals.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Using historical data, the model can forecast future budget needs and development trends. This helps in proactive planning and resource allocation.
- **Visualization Tools**: The model includes a suite of visualization tools that present data in an easy-to-understand format. Charts, graphs, and maps are used to illustrate budget allocations and development compliance.
- **Customizable Reports**: Users can generate customized reports based on specific criteria, such as geographic regions, budget categories, or development projects. This feature allows for targeted analysis and reporting.

## Installation

To install and set up the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ISI-Submission.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ISI-Submission
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data Requirements

The model requires the following data inputs:

- **Budget Data**: A CSV file containing columns for budget categories, amounts, and fiscal years.
- **Development Standards Data**: A CSV file with columns for project names, descriptions, compliance status, and evaluation criteria.

## Example Data Format

### Budget Data
| Category       | Amount  | Fiscal Year |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Infrastructure | 5000000 | 2023        |
| Education      | 3000000 | 2023        |
| Healthcare     | 2000000 | 2023        |

### Development Standards Data
| Project Name       | Description                      | Compliance Status | Evaluation Criteria |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| New Park           | Development of a new urban park  | Compliant         | Environmental Impact|
| School Renovation  | Renovation of public schools     | Non-Compliant     | Safety Standards    |

## Output

The model generates the following outputs:

- **Budget Analysis Report**: A detailed report on budget allocations, highlighting areas of over or under-spending.
- **Development Standards Report**: An assessment of development projects, indicating compliance with standards and guidelines.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representations of budget data and development compliance, including bar charts, pie charts, and maps.

## Conclusion

The Urban Budget Analysis and Development Standards Model is a powerful tool for analyzing urban financial management and development practices. By providing detailed insights and visualizations, the model helps stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance urban development and ensure efficient use of resources.
